![How_to_Make_your_Very_Own_AWS_Shortcut_Command (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c11f4f5-b532-4fd4-8214-65e73284d23b)

# 1) Make a File 
Make a file through the 'touch' command and name it 'openaws.sh' or 'openubuntu.sh', you get the idea. (just remember to end it in .sh). Then open the file using vim editor but you can use other editors like 'vscode'.
(vscode is better... but my Windows aint doing any favors ðŸ˜­)

# 2) The Script

- Once you type 'echo $PATH' select any path within your server (I recommend using /home/bin)
- When selecting your path, end the path with the name of your file (without the .sh) 
- Then all you need to do is:

*ps: if you're a windows user then just enter your terminal as administrator then at this stage press 'mv' without 'sudo'*

# 4) TRY IT!

Dont believe me? just type your file on its own anywhere in your server and... watch your AWS come to life!
